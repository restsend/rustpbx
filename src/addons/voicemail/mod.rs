//! Voicemail addon stub.
//!
//! The full Voicemail Pro implementation lives in the `rustpbx-addons` repository
//! and is compiled into the main crate via symlink at `src/voicemail/`.
//!
//! This module is intentionally minimal.  When the `addon-voicemail` feature is
//! enabled, `crate::voicemail::VoicemailAddon` (from rustpbx-addons) is used
//! directly by the addon registry.  This file is kept only as a placeholder
//! for the `src/addons/voicemail/` directory.
//!
//! Do NOT add functionality here — all voicemail code belongs in rustpbx-addons.
